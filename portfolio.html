					<h3>Clean the Realm | March 2015</h3>
					<p><em>What is it:</em> An application prototype to help roommates keep their living space clean and manage household chores using gamification techniques.</p>
					<p><em>Why I'm proud of it:</em> It was a quarter long group project and our team walked away with some awesome deliverables and learned a great deal about design thinking and working as a group for an extended period. At the time, I only knew Java, and was thrilled to be able to create so much with only that (hence prototype).</p>
					<p><em>Skills Learned:</em> Research Interviewing | Prototyping | User Testing | Creating Design Specs &amp; Process Books</p>

					<h3>Dawg Coffee | September 2015</h3>
					<p><em>What is it:</em> Dawg-Coffee is a semantically rich website for a coffee venue near the University of Washington (Go Huskies!).</p>
					<p><em>Why I'm proud of it:</em> This was my first time creating a website, and I succeeded in creating an aesthetically pleasing Website, learning to link pages efficiently, and overcoming the struggles of svg attribute editing.</p>
					<p><em>Skills Learned:</em> HTML | CSS | Mobile First | Bootstrap</p>

					<h3>Police Shooting Map | October 2015</h3>
					<p><em>What is it:</em> A dynamic map showing instances of police shootings (from <a href="http://regressing.deadspin.com/deadspin-police-shooting-database-update-were-still-go-1627414202">deadspin</a> database). Colors indicate whether victims were armed or unarmed, and users can filter instances by victim age.</p>
					<p><em>Why I'm proud of it:</em> This was the first API I had to navigate with limited assistance, and I did so successfully. Also proud of my algorithm for calculating incident outcomes (hit, killed, unknown) which prompted a few classmates to say "damn, that's cool."</p>
					<p><em>Skills Learned:</em> Leaflet | JavaScript | jQuery</p>

			<div id="Review">
				<div class="col-xs-12, col-md-9">
					<h3>Magic the Gathering: Card Review | October 2015</h3>
					<p><em>What is it:</em> A website to review your favorite Magic The Gathering cards (just kidding, it only lets you review one... for now). It interacts with its Parse database, to give a list of previous reviews, which users may then interact with, voting up or down for usefullness, or deleting.</p>
					<p><em>Why I'm proud of it:</em> Understanding some of the complexities of working with an online database and its API was very challenging for a first time user, but I was determined to make it work, and I did! In addition, I was able to understand what was going on enough so that I could help out fellow classmates, which is one of the most rewarding experiences for me.</p>
					<p><em>Skills Learned:</em> Parse | Database Management | Code Injection Protection</p>
