						<em>Hey, it’s Diana!</em> As a junior in the <em>UW Information School</em>, my current life is full of writing research papers, learning various web development functions <i>(Hey look! I just made this website!)</i>. When I am not doing that though, I enjoy spending time with my glorious cats, cooking, doing active things, and reading.

						A bit more about me: I was born in the bay area, with wonderfully nerdy, tech-savy parents; we moved to <em>Bozeman, Montana</em> when I was in the third grade, where I spent all my free time hiking, skiing, and exploring with my black labs. I even did the ultra cool sport, dog agility <i>(and went to nationals in 2008 getting 7th place  (out of 8…)  in the Juniors division, and winning the prestigious Junior Sportsmanship Award)</i>. In high school, I was heavily involved with Bozeman’s Speech &amp; Debate team, 4-H club, Art Club, and a handful of others organizations. My love for photography was sparked, and I started taking pictures of everything, something I wish I had more time to do today…  I was the <em>4-H Montana Ambassador President</em> my last year of high school, which let me travel all around Montana, helping at fairs, creating workshops and retreats for 4-H leaders statewide, I even got to build a time machine <i>(seriously- intro skits get quite epic when I’m involved)</i>.

					</figure>
					<p>
						Flash forward to college! I met some fantastic people, those people convinced me to take a intro to programming class, aaand I was hooked! Joining UW’s yoga club introduced me to another fitness love, so naturally I became their photography officer. I completed a <em>summer internship for Quantum Design</em> in San Diego, a physics laboratory instrument firm, during which I learned VisualBasic <i>(meh)</i> and WinWrap <i>(yuck)</i>, while testing their VersaLab system and software for its summer release. <a href="Internship.pdf" title="Griffing Testing Presentation">(Here is the Intern Colloquium Presentation I gave)</a>.

					<p>
						Since then, I was accepted into the <em>Informatics program (YAAAY!)</em>, took a year off to get in-state residency, working as a nanny to four awesome kids, and selling shoes. My roommates and I adopted two fantastic cats, <em>Tank and Atlas</em> <i>(with me being their forever home, awww!)</i>. I also took up running; finishing my first 10K in October 2014, and less than 11 months later, ran my first half marathon, <em>Black Diamond Half Marathon</em>, this past September (2015). That brings us to this fall, when I got to go back to school <i>(for a third of the price $$$)</i>, and have started volunteering with an awesome nation-wide organization, <em>ChickTech</em>, which helps get middle and high school girls interested in and involved with the tech industry, and gives current women in tech support, community, and workshops for things like ‘How to negotiate your paycheck’. Anyways, that’s a short version of who I am and what I’m about. Thanks for reading!

					<h3>Clean the Realm | March 2015</h3>
					<p><em>What is it:</em> An application prototype to help roommates keep their living space clean and manage household chores using gamification techniques.</p>
					<p><em>Why I'm proud of it:</em> It was a quarter long group project and our team walked away with some awesome deliverables and learned a great deal about design thinking and working as a group for an extended period. At the time, I only knew Java, and was thrilled to be able to create so much with only that (hence prototype).</p>
					<p><em>Skills Learned:</em> Research Interviewing | Prototyping | User Testing | Creating Design Specs &amp; Process Books</p>

					<h3>Dawg Coffee | September 2015</h3>
					<p><em>What is it:</em> Dawg-Coffee is a semantically rich website for a coffee venue near the University of Washington (Go Huskies!).</p>
					<p><em>Why I'm proud of it:</em> This was my first time creating a website, and I succeeded in creating an aesthetically pleasing Website, learning to link pages efficiently, and overcoming the struggles of svg attribute editing.</p>
					<p><em>Skills Learned:</em> HTML | CSS | Mobile First | Bootstrap</p>

			<div id="Map">
				<div class="col-xs-12, col-md-9">
					<h3>Police Shooting Map | October 2015</h3>
					<p><em>What is it:</em> A dynamic map showing instances of police shootings (from <a href="http://regressing.deadspin.com/deadspin-police-shooting-database-update-were-still-go-1627414202">deadspin</a> database). Colors indicate whether victims were armed or unarmed, and users can filter instances by victim age.</p>
					<p><em>Why I'm proud of it:</em> This was the first API I had to navigate with limited assistance, and I did so successfully. Also proud of my algorithm for calculating incident outcomes (hit, killed, unknown) which prompted a few classmates to say "damn, that's cool."</p>
					<p><em>Skills Learned:</em> Leaflet | JavaScript | jQuery</p>

			<div id="Review">
				<div class="col-xs-12, col-md-9">
					<h3>Magic the Gathering: Card Review | October 2015</h3>
					<p><em>What is it:</em> A website to review your favorite Magic The Gathering cards (just kidding, it only lets you review one... for now). It interacts with its Parse database, to give a list of previous reviews, which users may then interact with, voting up or down for usefullness, or deleting.</p>
					<p><em>Why I'm proud of it:</em> Understanding some of the complexities of working with an online database and its API was very challenging for a first time user, but I was determined to make it work, and I did! In addition, I was able to understand what was going on enough so that I could help out fellow classmates, which is one of the most rewarding experiences for me.</p>
					<p><em>Skills Learned:</em> Parse | Database Management | Code Injection Protection</p>
