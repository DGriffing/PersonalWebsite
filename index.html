						<em>Hey, it’s Diana!</em> As a junior in the <em>UW Information School</em>, my current life is full of writing research papers, learning various web development functions <i>(Hey look! I just made this website!)</i>. When I am not doing that though, I enjoy spending time with my glorious cats, cooking, doing active things, and reading.

						A bit more about me: I was born in the bay area, with wonderfully nerdy, tech-savy parents; we moved to <em>Bozeman, Montana</em> in third grade, where I spent all my free time hiking, skiing, and exploring with my black labs. I even did the ultra cool sport, dog agility <i>(and went to nationals in 2008 getting 7th place  (out of 8…)  in the Juniors division, and winning the prestigious Junior Sportsmanship Award)</i>. In high school, I was heavily involved with Bozeman’s Speech &amp; Debate team, 4-H club, Art Club, and a handful of others organizations. My love for photography was sparked, and I started taking pictures of everything, something I wish I had more time to do today…  I was the <em>4-H Montana Ambassador President</em> my last year of high school, which let me travel all around Montana, helping at fairs, creating workshops and retreats for 4-H leaders statewide, I even got to build a time machine <i>(seriously- intro skits get quite epic when I’m involved)</i>.

						Flash forward to college! I met some fantastic people, those people convinced me to take a intro to programming class, aaand I was hooked! Joining UW’s yoga club introduced me to another fitness love, so naturally I became their photography officer. I completed a <em>summer internship for Quantum Design</em> in San Diego, a physics laboratory instrument firm, during which I learned VisualBasic <i>(meh)</i> and WinWrap <i>(yuck)</i>, while testing their VersaLab system and software for its summer release. <a href="Internship.pdf" title="Griffing Testing Presentation">(Here is the Intern Colloquium Presentation I gave)</a>.

						Since then, I was accepted into the <em>Informatics program (YAAAY!)</em>, took a year off to get in-state residency, working as a nanny to four awesome kids, and selling shoes. I also took up running; finishing my first 10K in October 2014, and less than 11 months later, ran my first half marathon, <em>Black Diamond Half Marathon</em>, this past September (2015). That brings us to this fall, when I got to go back to school <i>(for a third of the price $$$)</i>, and have started volunteering with an awesome nation-wide organization, <em>ChickTech</em>, which helps get middle and high school girls interested in and involved with the tech industry, and gives current women in tech support, community, and workshops for things like ‘How to negotiate your paycheck’. Anyways, that’s a short version of who I am and what I’m about. Thanks for reading!
